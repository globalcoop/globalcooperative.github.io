### Preamble

Considering that

- All people in the world are entitled to peace—to live lives of security and tranquility, free from the fear of violence;
- All people in the world are entitled to health—to be free from hunger and illness, to be protected from environmental threats, and to have access to high-quality preventative and curative health care;
- All people in the world are entitled to nature: to sustainably enjoy the benefits of ecosystem services—clean air and water, energy, food, recreation, and other resources;

And that

- All states have the right to sovereignty—to exercise control over their territory and provide for their citizens in the manner they choose;

We establish a decentralized organization, the Global Cooperative, to restore, safeguard, and enhance humanity’s collective goods: peace, health, and nature.

### Article 1. General Principles

1.  Fundamental equality. Every woman, man, and child in the world has the same intrinsic value, and the actions of the Cooperative, in its efforts to protect peace, health, and nature, will affirm this fundamental equality. This equality extends into the future: the decisions of the Cooperative will take into account the needs of generations to come.

2.  Individual autonomy. The Cooperative shall advance the right of each individual to think, speak, and act without interference by states or other groups, insofar as actions do not interfere with the rights of other individuals to do the same.

3.  Cooperative action. The Cooperative will be guided by its objective of building a structure in which individuals can safely work together for mutual benefit in social, political, and economic spheres.

### Article 2. Social Rights & Responsibilities

1.  Voting shares and citizen-trusteeship. Each woman and man in the world above the age of 18 is entitled to one voting share that confers the right to participate in the Cooperative as an equal citizen, as well as the responsibility to participate in the trusteeship of the world’s collective goods.

2.  Digital identity. Possessing a voting share allows the citizen-trustee to create an online digital identity. The citizen-trustee’s true demographic information is secure and not publicly available.

3.  Digital access and literacy. Recognizing that access to the Cooperative’s digital infrastructure is partially determined by socioeconomic status, geographical location, and knowledge, the Cooperative has the responsibility of expanding global digital access and digital literacy.

4.  Social network & open-source collaboration. The possession of a voting share also enrolls the citizen-trustee in the Cooperative’s social network, within which s/he has the right to communicate with other citizen-trustees, collaborate on the creation of policies, programs, and projects, and provide feedback on the ideas and actions of the Cooperative community.

5.  Reputation and resilience.  The Cooperative relies on distributed rewards and disincentives; every citizen-trustee may indicate their approval or disapproval of the ideas and actions of others. These evaluations are aggregated into a reputation score that provides a signal to citizen-trustees about the commitment and contribution of each individual to the protection of global collective goods.

6. Access to information. The Cooperative’s citizen-trustees maintain an open-access, freely editable information repository that provides data on the ongoing and estimated impact of policies, programs, and projects on the value of global collective goods. Cooperative members are responsible for quality control of the repository.

### Article 3. Political Rights & Responsibilities

1.  Delegative democracy. Citizen-trustees have the right to either vote directly or delegate their voting power to a trusted proxy. Citizen-trustees may also partition their vote if they wish, spreading their voting power over multiple delegates or Council candidates. Only citizen-trustees who have attained a reputation threshold, to be determined by the Cooperative community, may serve as delegates.

2.   Council structure. The Cooperative will establish three council bodies, one each for peace, health, and nature. Each Council contains seven members with equal voting rights. Again, only citizen-trustees who attain a pre-determined reputation threshold may serve as Councilors.

3.  Council duties. The Councils have the responsibility of meeting once a month to make decisions regarding the coordination and financing of global collective goods 3Ps. The Councils balance the restoration, management, and enhancement of global collective goods with the provision of short-term financial returns to Cooperative shareholders.

4.   First-stage community voting. In the first stage of the voting process, citizen-trustees have the right to approve or disapprove (or abstain on the judgment) of proposed policies, programs, and projects. Citizen-trustees may directly vote or delegate their vote. Policies, programs, and projects that surpass a specified threshold move to the second round of Council voting.

5.   Second-stage Council voting. The leading seven vote-getting delegates every month in each Council election are responsible for making the decisions described in Article 3.3.

6. Accountability. All citizen-trustees have the right of instant recall—withdrawal of delegated votes—at any time before a monthly Council begins session, and again once the monthly Council ends session.

7.  The High Council. Violations of the Constitution, including interference with state sovereignty, as well as major disputes arising between citizen-trustees, are adjudicated by a High Council composed of nine members: the five citizen-trustees with the highest reputation and four individuals nominated by the United Nations General Assembly.

8.  Constitutional reforms. The provisions in the Constitution may be modified by the convening of a special Constitutional Convention. The proposed modifications must first pass a higher threshold than that of regular 3P approval in the first-stage voting procedure described in Article 3.4. The Constitutional Convention is convened when this threshold is exceeded, and all 21 delegates in the three council bodies will vote in the second stage for final ratification of the modifications. Ratification requires a supermajority of 14 of the 21 delegates.

### Article 4. Economic Rights & Responsibilities

1.  Investment shareholding. Every citizen-trustee of the Cooperative has the right to buy additional investment shares. Investment shares are valued in a secure digital currency (see Article 4.6) and are able to be fractionally divided; possession of shares does not increase voting power within the Cooperative.

2.   Distributing free investment shares. The Cooperative has the responsibility of raising money to distribute investment shares freely to those who cannot afford to purchase them, in line with the objective of the Cooperative to include as many citizen-trustees as possible in the collaborative economy.

3.  Long-term social impact. The Cooperative has the responsibility of increasing the value of global collective goods through financing and implementing effective policies, programs, and projects. This may entail funding some initiatives that do not yield a strong monetary return, i.e., providing grants, concessional loans, or side payments to advance the common interests of the Cooperative.

4.  Sustainable returns for shareholders. Where possible and efficient, the Cooperative has the responsibility of creating viable policies, programs, and projects through market mechanisms, and thereby creating financially and environmentally sustainable returns for investment shareholders.

5.  Digital currency. The Cooperative conducts all transactions in a cryptocurrency created specially for the organization.

6.  The blockchain.  All information generated by the Cooperative, including the cryptocurrency, contractual transactions, the contents of the information repository, policy, program, and project designs, and public discussions are stored in a blockchain.
