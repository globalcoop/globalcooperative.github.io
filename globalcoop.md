In an era of grave threats to the world’s collective goods—most importantly, peace, health, and the natural environment—international cooperation is more important than ever. Nation-states and multilateral institutions have failed to catalyze meaningful action against climate change, the destruction of biodiversity, epidemic diseases, and a host of other pressing issues. We propose a new governance framework: a Global Cooperative (henceforth “the Cooperative”) that pools the ideas and resources of individuals across the world within a digital architecture, and directs these resources towards flexible, sustainable governance of the world’s collective goods. Members of the Cooperative are best described as citizen-trustees: citizens of a new global community, and trustees of the human and natural capital that   will   support   future   generations.
All people in the world are eligible to be citizen-trustees of the Cooperative. This focus on international cooperation among individuals is the Cooperative’s key innovation: global grassroots partnerships can make changes that other institutions cannot,   linking   political   constituencies,   pooling   resources,   and   coordinating   action.
